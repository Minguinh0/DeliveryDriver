It is a simple #2D delivery game that I created using Unity and C#.
The goal is to pick up kebaps on the street and bring them to the delivery point. You can carry only 1 kebap at a time!
Once you picked the kebap, the car turns red. You deliver the kebap, it turns blue again. So, you can understand if your car is loaded with kebap or not! 😁
There are speed-up points (yellow) on the roads which accelerate the delivery car. However, if you hit an obstacle which can be a house, tree, or a rock on the roadside, the car slows down again.
So try not to hit any obstacles and delivery your kebabs as soon as possible! 🤤
